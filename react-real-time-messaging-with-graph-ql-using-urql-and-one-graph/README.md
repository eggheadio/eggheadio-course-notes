## About 🔍

We are going to use OneGraph GraphQL server and urql GraphQL Client to build a real time chat application.

This repo contains notes from [Ian Jones](https://twitter.com/_jonesian)'s egghead course [React Real-Time Messaging with GraphQL using urql and OneGraph](https://egghead.io/playlists/build-a-github-issue-viewer-in-react-and-graphql-be5a).

These notes contain the same structure as the transcriptions, along with additional rewrites, links to resources, and personal takes on the lesson. Feel free to submit additions to these notes, but please don't remove anything (unless we messed up or misunderstood something).

Generally, there is one document for each lesson in the course. If there are related lessons, the notes will be in the same document.

## React/GraphQL Project 🎓
After completing the course and absorbing all of this knowledge, the best way to solidify it is by using it!

You can find a challenge written up for you to test your new GraphQL knowledge in the [Excercises folder](./exercises/README.md). We've given you a scenario for you to implement another feature that involves GraphQL subscriptions.

You'll notice that there is a community solutions file within the [Excercises](./exercises/community-solutions.md) section. We encourage you to submit a PR and add your solution!
