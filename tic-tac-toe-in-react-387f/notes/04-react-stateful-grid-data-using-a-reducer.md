The main goal of this lesson is to make our `grid` stateful and update when we clicked on cells in our game.

We will be using React's `useReducer` hook. You can find documentation of this hook [here] (https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)

We start by creating the initial state of the component and a reducer function toi accept current state and the action and return the next state. 

The code should look like this: 

```jsx
const initialState = {
    grid: newTicTacToeGrid()
}
 
const reducer = (state, action) => {
    return state
}
```

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="2:00" end="2:20">

How to make return the next state? We will make a clone of the current state and make mutations of that. With the purpose of returning an immutable state without changing the passed state.

 At this point we can see in our project that we can click values and we can see showing uo in our grid.
