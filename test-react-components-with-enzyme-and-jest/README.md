## About

These notes go along with the [Test React Components with Enzyme and Jest](https://egghead.io/courses/test-react-components-with-enzyme-and-jest) course from [Tyler Clark](https://egghead.io/instructors/tyler-clark)

In this course, construct tests for our [React]() components with [Enzyme]() and [Jest]().

Throughout this course, you will learn about

- Create React App setup
- Enzyme initial setup
- Enzyme configuration for specific versions of React
- Accepted selectors
- Rendering methods
- Working with React lifecycles
- Component state
- Component props
- Working with Redux-connected components
- Using Jest snapshots to
  - Guarantee the layout of component elements
  - Replicate user interaction
  - Test class methods

In the final lesson, we will recap these concepts through the testing of both a basic React form that sends an AJAX request on submit.

The code for each lesson in this course can be found [here](https://github.com/ParkerGits/react-enzyme-jest). Each branch contains code for its respective lesson. **THERE IS NO BRANCH FOR LESSON 1, SO THE BRANCH NUMBERS 1-14 CORRESPOND WITH LESSON NUMBERS 2-15**. Code for each lesson can also be found in the **Resources** section of each page of notes.
