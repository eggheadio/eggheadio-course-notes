# Install Enzyme and Configure Jest

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-install-enzyme-and-configure-jest)**

## Create React App
Create React App is the best way to start building a new single-page React application. More information on Create React App in the [resources below](#resources).

## Important Note about Create React App
With Create React App, the changes that the instructor makes to the project files are now unneeded. Simply run the following in the terminal to get started:
```
npx create-react-app react-enzyme-jest
```
```
cd react-enzyme-jest
```
With our project created, we can install Enzyme as a Dev Dependency:
```
npm install --save-dev enzyme
```
That's it! We don't need to make a **.babelrc** file, nor do we need to edit our test script in **package.json**.
