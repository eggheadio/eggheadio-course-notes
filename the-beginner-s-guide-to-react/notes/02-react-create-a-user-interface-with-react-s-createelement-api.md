## Notes

<TimeStamp start="0:28" end="0:31">
  
Add these scripts to get React on to the page. 

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@16.12.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.12.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
```  
  
</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="0:33" end="0:42">
  
  Hand React elements off to `react-dom` so it can handle converting them into DOM elements and rendering them to the page.
  
</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="0:46" end="1:00">
  
If youâ€™ve ever learned or used React before, youâ€™re probably more familiar with JSX than Reactâ€™s `createElement` API, but itâ€™s important to understand the `createElement` API first so you understand the magic.
  
</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="1:17" end="1:30">
    
The `React.createElement` API is as simple as the element that you want to create. Here we have a `<div>`, and then an object that has all of the props that you want to have applied.
  
</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="2:47" end="3:05">
    
Just as a convenience, in `React.createElement` all arguments after the props object are considered children.
