## Summary

Data structures and algorithms are not just for Computer Science graduates! Anyone can and should learn them! They will not only help you get through those nasty tech interviews but help you identify patterns in your day-to-day work that particular data structures or algorithms could help solve 🏋️‍♂️

This course is not about memorizing the implementation but understanding the benefits and tradeoffs.
