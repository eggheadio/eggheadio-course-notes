## About

In this course, Jason Lengstorf will take you from an empty project folder all the way through deployment of a Twilio-powered video chat app built on Gatsby.

Along the way you’ll learn powerful concepts like dynamic route handling in Gatsby, form management with React Hooks, writing custom React Hooks, context management and reducers in React, handling realtime interactions in a React app, creating serverless functions in Twilio, and setting up a Twilio account to support realtime video calling.

## You will learn how to:
- Create dynamic web apps using Gatsby
- Create and configure a Twilio account for enabling video calling
- Initialize and manage realtime interactions in a web app
- Handle complex application state using React Context and Hooks
- Write custom React Hooks to encapsulate application logic
