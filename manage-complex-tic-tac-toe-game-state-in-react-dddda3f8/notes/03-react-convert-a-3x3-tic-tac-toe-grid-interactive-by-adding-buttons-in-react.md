# Notes

<TimeStamp start="0:02" end="0:07">

We are going to add buttons in each cell to make our cells interactive

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="0:35" end="0:58">

The resulting code for out buttons is: 

```jsx
 <button
        css={{
          fontSize: '2.5rem',
          width: '100%',
          height: '100%',
        }}
        onClick={() => {})}
        type="button"
      >

```

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="1:45" end="1:52">

For more information about  lifting of state and state updaters in React review the following documentation [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html#lifting-state-up)

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="2:55" end="3:05">

So far we can see in our application that our buttons are interactive, and if we open the console we can see the x, y coordinates logged as objects
