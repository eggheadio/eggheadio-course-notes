- Svelte is a tool for building fast web applications.
- It&rsquo;s a bit similar to frameworks such React and Vue, which also share the same goal of building fast web interfaces.
- The difference between Svelt and other frameworks is that Svelte converts your app to optimized Javascript code when it is compiled. Instead of interpreting the application code at the run time.
- Svelte produces two things
  1.  Javascript code
  2.  CSS output
- The Javascript code is optimized for performance. The developer doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about that, its taken care of by the compiler
