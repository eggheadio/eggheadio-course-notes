# Create a Next.js app from scratch with create-next-app

-   Create a next app by running

```terminal
npx create-next-app my-nextjs-blog
```

-   You can pick a template, but for this coleection we will start from scratch.
-   This will install react, react-dom, and next using yarn
-   cd into the directory you created and run code to open vscode.

```
cd my-nextjs-blog
code .
```

-   The entry point of our next.js application will be `pages/index.js`
-   Run `yarn dev` to start the development server
-   Changes are reflected in the browser without having to refresh the page
-   The tiny widget in the right-hand corner of the screen tells us that the page is pre-rendered. **In Next.js we get server side rendering by default.**
