## Summary

In this lesson, we’ll replace static or inline values with dynamic values and pass data as JSON to the query from the Query Variables panel.

## Notes

We'll start by opening up a new tab in GraphQL Playground by clicking the plus, and we're going to use this new tab to write a new query. We'll use our `allPets` query from before, but this time, we want to pass in some optional arguments.


```graphql
query {
  allPets()
}
```

If we take a look at all pets in the schema, we'll see that category and status are potential filters for this query. I'm going to add `category:` `DOG`. We just want to see the dogs, and we just want to see those dogs that are `AVAILABLE`.

```graphql
query {
  allPets(category: DOG status: AVAILABLE) {
  }
}
```

Now, I can make a selection for id, name, status, and category, and I'll just see those dogs that are available.

<TimeStamp start="0:08" end="0:35">

```graphql
query {
  allPets(category: DOG status: AVAILABLE) {
    id
    name
    status
    category
  }
}
```

</TimeStamp>

Right now, these values are being passed in-line as strings with the query, but we also have the option to provide values as dynamic values.

Let's say you wanted to build a UI for this. You might have some dropdown filters. You'd need some sort of mechanism for passing back dynamic user input. To pass dynamic values with a GraphQL query, we're going to use variables.

The first thing I want to do is I want to set up these variables on line one. We're going to use the dollar sign and `category`, and then we'll define what type category is, which is `petCategory`. Then we'll provide status, which is `petStatus`.

```graphql
query($category: PetCategory $status: PetStatus) {
  allPets(category: DOG status: AVAILABLE) {
    id
    name
    status
    category
  }
}
```

Next, we'll provide these variables to our allPets query by using the dollar sign and the name of the argument.

<TimeStamp start="1:05" end="1:23">

```graphql
query($category: PetCategory $status: PetStatus) {
  allPets(category: $category status: $status) {
    id
    name
    status
    category
  }
}
```

</TimeStamp>

Now, if I click play, we're going to have these variables set up, but we're not passing any values yet. This is just going to give me everything.

Because those values are nullable, we can provide null, and this will just show me all of the pets. When I want to provide those values, I'm going to open up the query variables panel. Here, I'm going to pass the values as JSON.

<TimeStamp start="1:35" end="1:45">

```graphql
{
  "category": "DOG"
  "status": "AVAILABLE"
}
```

</TimeStamp>

I'll provide the `category` and the `status` to find those available dogs. These values will then be passed, and our response should reflect that.

This will be dynamic, so I can change it to cat. This will show me all the available cats.

```
{
  "category": "CAT"
  "status": "AVAILABLE"
}
```

The GraphQL query language also gives us a way to pass default values for these variables. For example, if I set the default with an equals sign to `STINGRAY` for `PetCategory`, and I click play, the default isn't going to be used. We're still going to pull those values from the query variables.

<TimeStamp start="2:07" end="2:23">

```
query ($category: PetCategory=STINGRAY $status: PetStatus){
  allPets(category: $category status: $status) {
    id
    name
    status
    category
  }
}
```

</TimeStamp>

However, if I remove that, and I don't pass the cat value, then it will use the default. If that value is not provided, we're going to use the default.

## Personal Take

⚠️ Note: We have to debug our input variable to be in a format which can be validated by our GraphQL schema.rename the result of a field to anything you want.
