## Summary

To run the example project, we'll need to set up a shopify partner account, which is what they call their developer accounts.

## Notes

[00:00](https://egghead.io/lessons/gatsby-set-up-a-shopify-account#t=0) Set up your Shopify account at [Shopify Partners program](https://www.shopify.com/partners). Shopify Partner is what Shopify calls their developers.

Create a development store, Chris calls his Corgi Supply Inc.

[00:50](https://egghead.io/lessons/gatsby-set-up-a-shopify-account#t=50) **Set up a Product in your store**, he uses corgi stickers.

[01:04](https://egghead.io/lessons/gatsby-set-up-a-shopify-account#t=64) Now we want to go to Apps (in the side bar) -> manage private apps -> **create new private app**.

[01:20](https://egghead.io/lessons/gatsby-set-up-a-shopify-account#t=80) By default, you have most of the access that you need, but we'll also need to enable the store for an API at the bottom. After enabling the store for an API, make sure that you have Read product tags also enabled in the Read products, variants, and collections option and save.

[01:34](https://egghead.io/lessons/gatsby-set-up-a-shopify-account#t=94)  We use the **Storefront access token in our app** but copy that for later.

[01:53](https://egghead.io/lessons/gatsby-set-up-a-shopify-account#t=113) The plugin we'll be using is [Gatsby Source Shopify](https://github.com/angeloashmore/gatsby-source-shopify) and the permissions can be found in How to Use section of the Read Me.
