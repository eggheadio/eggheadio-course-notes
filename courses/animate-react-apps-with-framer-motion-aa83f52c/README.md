## About 🔍

This repo contains notes on Will Johnson's "Animate React Apps with Framer Motion" course. These notes follow along the course and guide you as you create animations using some of the tools Framer Motion has to offer. 

## Course Objective 💪

Understand the basics of creating animations in a react app with Framer-motion


## My Take  

I enjoyed this course! It really shows how Framer motion can easily be applied to your react app making your app more interactive 

## issues 🔧

I couldn't find the lesson code anywhere on the course. With some help finding It, I got the link here: https://codesandbox.io/s/github/wjohnson85/egghead-framer-motion

Lesson 09 is the setup and should be lesson 01
