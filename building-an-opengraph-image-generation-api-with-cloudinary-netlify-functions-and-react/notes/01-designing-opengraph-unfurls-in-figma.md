The first thing we're going to do is design the template in Figma using [this template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/820337605519256142) from [Ryan Warner](https://twitter.com/ryanwarnercodes).

Duplicate the Template on the top right 

</TimeStamp>
<TimeStamp start="0:46" end="0:51">

On the left hand side, navigate to "Open Graph Image"

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="0:52" end="1:07">

An Open Graph image is what we use to preview when a page is shared on Twitter, Discord, Slack, Facebook, etc.

You can get a background from [Gradient Magic](https://www.gradientmagic.com) for free. Click on Edit, if you have brand colors (or just colors you like) now would be a great time to plug them in!

You should go ahead and copy the CSS to a notepad for later, we'll use it in the next lesson and you don't want to have to go back and get it later.

The are some slightly differences in the website Gradient Magic since the course was recorded, however, those are not major breaking changes and you can follow the steps below to obtain the image: 

Inspect the image and adjust the CSS by adding `height:630px; width: 1200px;`  to the div with the id `gradientContainer`. 

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="2:57" end="3:06">

There is not need to follow these steps, since the new version of the website does not have these problems. 

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="3:08" end="3:22">

Now we need to take a screenshot of this node:

🍎 **In Safari** you can right click on the div and select "Capture Screenshot". You"ll then be prompted to save the file.
**In Windows/Linux** on the div you can select "ctrl" + "p" and type `>screenshot` and select "Capture node screenshot"

<TimeStamp start="3:30" end="3:39">

Drag the image into Figma and its the right size, and ready to go.

</TimeStamp>
<TimeStamp start="4:04" end="4:30">

Next create a rectangle in Figma, a little smaller than your canvas (1160 X 590) and put it at the center of your background.

</TimeStamp>
<TimeStamp start="5:00" end="5:12">

Choose a color from the background for the rectangle and then adjust the lightness so that it is either dark or light (depending on whether you want light or dark text)

</TimeStamp>
<TimeStamp start="5:35" end="5:50">

Continue to adjust and prototype your design in Figma, but remember that you don't need to spend a lot of time making everything perfect. The goal is to get the idea down on paper and then reference it later when we build a React component.

To add some text you either need to select the "T" button on the left side of the navbar or hit "T" on the keyboard. 


</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="6:54" end="3:22">

To modify the text color, font and other properties, navigate in the right side menu
