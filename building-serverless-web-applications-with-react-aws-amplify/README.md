## About 🔍

React makes it intuitive to build real-world web application. But in reality, you need to use a host of other services to get the app in front of real users.

This course walks you through setup and implementation to get your cloud-based application up and running.

You’ll learn to set up:

- Install and configure AWS Amplify into your React applications
- Add services like Authentication, APIs using GraphQL, interact and deploy Serverless functions and store data in Amazon S3.
- deploy your React application and make it available to all your users.

## Course Goal

You’ll finish the course ready to quickly and easily deploy your serverless React application, so users can start using and enjoying it right away.
