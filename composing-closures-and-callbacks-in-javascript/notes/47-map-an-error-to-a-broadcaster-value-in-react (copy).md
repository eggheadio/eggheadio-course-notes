# Map an Error to a Broadcaster Value in React

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-map-an-error-to-a-broadcaster-value-in-react)**

In the world of web appplications and in general in any user facing interface, error handling is an important topic, minify the friction for the user is a way to make your application successful.

In this example we are using a Promise to handle the response of the `fetch` call, the promises can fail, in this case we are triggering an error in the Promise by cancelling the call. This errors can be caught by using the `catch`  block and writing the handling logic inside of that block

```javascript
let getURL = url => listener => {
  let controller = new AbortController()
  let signal = controller.signal
  fetch(url, { signal })
    .then(response => {
      return response.json()
    })
    .then(json => {
      listener(json)
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.log(error)
    })

  return () => {
    controller.abort()
  }
}
```

In this part of the example we are just loggin out the error. but what we want is to be able to handle that in a better way. Following our patterns, we can create an operator that takes care of this value.



The logic for this new operator is to transform or **map** the erro value to a new shape, so we will name the operator as `mapError`. In a similar way as our previous operators this operator takes a `transform` a `broadcaster` and a `listener`.

This operator will receive every value that comes from the `broadcaster` so we need to filter the type of the value so it can act only for errors. That is being done by checking the  if the value is instance of `Error` object, in that case the `transform` is applied and pushed back to the `listener`, in other case just push to `listener`

```javascript
let mapError = transform => broadcaster => listener => {
  return broadcaster(value => {
    if (value instanceof Error) {
      listener(transform(value))
      return
    }

    listener(value)
  })
}
```

Now with this logic for the operator we just need to wrap the call to `getUrl` and define the  `tranform` function

```javascript
mapError(error => ({ login: error.message }))(
  getURL("https://api.github.com/users/johnlindquist")
)(console.log)
```



That is the same as this 

```javascript
const transform = error => {
  return {
		login: error.message	
  }
}
const response =   getURL("https://api.github.com/users/johnlindquist")
mapError(transform)(response)(value => {
  console.log(value)
})
```
