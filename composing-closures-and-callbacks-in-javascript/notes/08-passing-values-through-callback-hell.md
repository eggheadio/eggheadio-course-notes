#Â Passing Values Through Callback Hell 

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-passing-values-through-callback-hell)**


In the [previous lesson](7-solve-callback-hell-with-composition.md) we avoid the situation of passing values through the callbacks, to do this we need to define a *mapping* function that will accept the value and create the callback based on a configuration step that includes this value.
To do that, each of the functions defined will now be wrapped by another function that accepts a `config` parameter like:

```javascript
let click = config => listener => {
    document.addEventListener(config, listener)
}
```

With this in place we need to change our mental model and think about the `mappInner` function as a function that creates or generates callbacks with the correct values.

```javascript
let nest = mapInner => outer => listener => {
    outer(config => {
        let innerr = mapInner(config)
        inner(listener)
    })
}
```
ðŸ”‘ So now, instead of think abotu nested callback, we can think of what value is the function receiving and how we want to configure the inner callback.
