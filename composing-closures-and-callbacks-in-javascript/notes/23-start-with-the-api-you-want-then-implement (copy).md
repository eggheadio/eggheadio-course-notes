# Start With the API You Want Then Implement

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-start-with-the-api-you-want-then-implement)**

Is a good practice when defining your functions to first decide how you want to use that function, meaning, define the API of the function to then be able to implement the function according that signature.

In the example shown in the lesson, the definition of `myZip` shows a clear function signature showing first that the broadcasters are received and then the operators are applied to the emited data, representing the javascript interpreter (the browser in this case) behavior.
