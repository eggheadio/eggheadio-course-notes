# Prevent Certain Values with a Filter Operator

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-prevent-certain-values-with-a-filter-operator)**

We can re-use our new `map` operator to accomplish the same behavior of typewriting but by ussing our new patterns, we can move some logic out of our `modify` operator into the `transform` argument of the `map` operator.

```javascript
let typeGreeting = map(toLower, modify(map(x => x[1], zip(
    createInterval(100),
    forOf("Hello, John")
))))
```


Now is easy to see that in the `transform` argument of `map` we are taking the value identify by `x` and performing an operation on it. With that notion we can create a new kind of operator, a **filter**, an operator that can skip or remove a value based on some condition.

The common use case for this is that the filter accepts a function named `predicate` that evaluates certain condition and if the `predicate` function returns `true` then the value is "added" or "removed" otherwise.

```javascript
let filter = curry((predicate, broadcaster, listener) => {
    return broadcaster(value => {
        if (value === done) {
            listener(done)
            return
        }
        if (predicate(value)) {
            listener(value)
        }
    })
})
```



This operator is very similar to our `map` operator, it operates over each value of the iterator but instead of **transform** the value it filters out some of them based on the result of the `predicate` function.
