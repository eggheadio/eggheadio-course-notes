- the important thing highlighted in this lesson is that the key to the success of making functions, composable and easily reusable, is that all of them respect the same function signature. that means that the inputs and outputs are identical almost all the time.
- If two functions implement the same _shape_ or _signature_, it does not matter how or in which order you call them, you will be able to compose them the way you want/need in your applications
