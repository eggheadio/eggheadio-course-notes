# Use the Debugger in a React Native App

## Debugger tools

A `debugger` statement placed in your React Native code will pause execution and bring up the debugger tools. Here we can check the current value of different variables, set other breakpoints, and watch particular variables we are interested in.

Enabling `Pause on caught exceptions` checkbox will pause execution of the app and open the debugger tools immediately before the exception is thrown. This is a fantastic way to quickly identify why an unexpected exception is being thrown.
