# Clear an initial AWS CDK stack to start building an app from scratch

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/aws-clear-an-initial-aws-cdk-stack-to-start-building-an-app-from-scratch)**

Cleaning time! We'll be removing some code generated by the `sample-app` that we don't need.

Go to `todo-app-stack` and remove all the references to `sns.Topic` and `sqs.Queue`. Remove the unused imports as well.

Run `cdk diff` to preview your changes (we'll be **destroying** a bunch of resources).

Then `cdk deploy` to deploy (note this will overwrite your previous deploy).

Verify your changes in the AWS console.
