# Deploy a site with HTTPS support behind a CDN with CDK

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/aws-deploy-a-site-with-https-support-behind-a-cdn-with-cdk)**

We want our website to be secure and served on `https` (and not on `http`) - let's fix that.

Also, in the previous lesson, we had to type out the three steps for deploying our frontend:

* Creating a bucket
* Creating a bucket deployment
* Creating a CloudFormation output

We can solve both things by using [CDK-SPA-Deploy](https://github.com/nideveloper/CDK-SPA-Deploy)! It can be used to deploy an SPA (Single Page Application), written in `reactJS` (or Angular/Vue) to `aws` behind SSL (meaning `https`) on CloudFront.

To add it, run:
* `npm install --save cdk-spa-deploy`

ðŸ¤” [Cloudfront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) is Amazon's CDN (Content Delivery Network).

Import it to the stack file:

* `import { SPADeploy } from "cdk-spa-deploy";`

Then comment out (or remove) the three sections that we wrote in the last time lesson and replace them with:

```ts
new SPADeploy(this, "WebsiteDeployment").createSiteWithCloudfront({
    indexDoc: "index.html",
    websiteFolder: "../frontend/build"
});
```
